# AnalisisSurvivalExample4
You might not understand what it is. 
It is one of my tasks in the Survival Analysis course that I took at my college. 
The problem is, I have to explain, or actually, I have to construct the three-sample test (Log-Rank test) table by myself. 
It was supposed to be made in Excel, but I made it in R Studio. 
Just because I think it is more comfortable, even though my code ends up such a mess.   

Here I used BMT (Bone Marrow Transplantation) dataset, taken from the KMsurv package in R Studio. 
I tried to analyze whether the disease-free survival function from three populations (ALL, AML low-risk, and AML high-risk patients) are different. 
(Look more Example 7.4 at pages 212).  

It was not supposed to be shared. 
You can see that I wrote the comments in Bahasa Indonesia. 
But let me appreciate my work and save it in here because I'm surprisingly done it with so many code lines which are not efficient. 

Let it be a part of my experiences~
